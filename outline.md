Themes I want to hit:

* Implementing Dada, process I have followed
* Experience doing PhD
* Fun to build things people can play with
* Technologies of interest
    * LSP
    * Web Assembly

Vague outline



* Niko's one rule of compilers
    * Pick the right Intermediate Representation for the job
* This starts before you start writing your compiler
    * Example: for Dada, I started by writing the tutorial
    * (Give brief walkthrough to give them the idea)
    * This tutorial went through a lot of iterations
* I am larely doing this in my head
    * There is interesting work being done on taking it from there
        * (cite some HCI work, Felienne, Hicks, etc)
    * Show the things
* Redex (Racket)
    * I also spent a while playing with redex
    * Really, really great tool
    * No, you can't do proofs
    * No, it doesn't matter that much
* A bit about Rust/chalk/etc?
* The research spiral
* Phase 2: Actually writing code
* Phase 2: The yak shave
    * picture of shaving a yak
* Salsa: Responsive compilers
    * Key idea of salsa
    * 
* Phase 3: Writing code
    * Spike technique
    * End to end, then fill in
* A bit about open source
    * Not saying you'll be able to build an open source community
    * There's a kind of magic to getting people to pay attention
        * and sometimes it's the dark sorcery kind
    * But getting engagement is awesome
    * All about the scaffolding
* Phase 4: 
    * Picking the right IR
* Fin

# Where do ideas come from?

* Feedback from others (synthesizing)
* Dropping constraints (ah-ha!)

---

# No spark? No problem!

* As a grad student, I think this bedeviled me most
* What do you do when you have no idea of what to do?
